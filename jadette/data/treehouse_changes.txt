These are the main changes:

Conversion to obj format.
Renaming of objects, materials and files.
Modified roughness and metalness.
Removal of lightmap component and replaced by ambient occlusion.
Separation of some parts as separate objects.
Separation of lowest part of trees, ladder and winch rope to separate objects and
setting of alpha vertex colors - this is to model the fog as transparency. In the 
original model this is made by having a separate UV-set and a special part of the 
texture for the alpha values. Also removed that part of the texture.
Conversion of textures to dds format.
